		<h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>
			<!-- Add reflection questions below -->
			
			<!-- question1 -->
			<p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</strong></p>
			<p>
					Vocabulary includes such as the tag head, which includes general information about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets. The body tag element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyper links, images, tables, etc. The paragraph element or "p" tag includes information surrounding a topic within the HTML document. All headings like h1 being the most important therefore largest, and h6 being the least important and therefore largest. Another term is list, which organizes all thoughts within the html. Unordered list allow organizations by bullets and ordered list allow organizations by bullets. Doctype tag is the first tag, which allows instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. The Title tag succeeds the doctype tag and allows a name that differentiates it from other work. All these skills are essential in the makeup of this unit and HTML in totality.
			</p>
			
			<!-- question2 -->
			<p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</strong></p>
			<p> 
					The most important skills must be the structure of html, and the ability to make clickable links that allow organization.
			</p>
			<!-- question3 -->
			<p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</strong></p>
			<p>
					I have gotten better in all facets such as formatting a document, when to use tags, and the recognition of my mistakes.
			</p>
			<!-- question4 -->
			<p><strong>In what ways do you think you need to improve? </strong></p>
			<p> 
					I need to focus when list or paragraph usage fits and I need to check my code throughly.
			</p>
			<!-- question5 -->
			<p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</strong></p>
			<p>
					The first problem was where to place the main tag, but after reviewing my organization, I knew that the main tag didn't have to be in the beginning of the code. It could be at the start of the list of units too. The second problem was how to create a clickable link on the units. I realized I didn't put quotation marks after checking my code, which are essentially to the creation of a clickable link.
			</p>
			<!-- question6 -->
			<p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</strong></p>
			<p>
					I always thought creating a web page would be impossible, but after learning the in and outs I feel like I could finally accomplish this. </li>
			</p>
			<!-- question6 -->
			
			<p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</strong></p>
			<p>
					At times I may had done unnecessary work although I got the job done. For example putting all eight units instead of the necessary six.
			</p>
		<h2>Unit 2: Creating & Planning a Web Page</h2>
			<!-- question1 -->
			<p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</strong></p>
			<p>
					The vocabulary terms necessary for creating a web page are font-size, font-weight, and font-family. All these terms allow the words' perfect depiction into website concepts. Color targets certain areas' color scheme to mirror the website's concept and background-color targets the whole overall website's color scheme. Hexidecimal value signifies a color for css to utilize, whereas RGB value signifies how much red, green, and blue are in that specific. HSL signies the hue, saturation, and lightness. The css style sheet is where true imagery and planning through all these aspects occur.
			</p>
			<!-- question2 -->
			<p><strong>	What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</strong></p>
			<p>
					Skills that proved their importance were colors ability to influence the mind's perception. Utilization of styling words in order for certain aspects to stand out or blend in. Recognition of how numbers affect colors. Overall application of style to affect a webpage.
			</p>
			<!-- question3 -->
			<p><strong>	In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</strong></p>
			<p>
					My previous webpage format dismissed color, therefore made it seem illegitimate. Now I can style the webpage in a way where my constent sticks out. My font usage has always been Times New Roman, however now I recognize the affect of fonts on webpages. Lastly, my webpage organization has improved from a sloppy nature to slick design that focuses on content and styling.
			</p>
			<!-- question4 -->
			<p><strong>	In what ways do you think you need to improve?</strong></p>
			<p>
					My website follows a very simple format. I wish to implement a website that wows my audience versus the plain website it is. My presentation needs work; implementation of a true navigation bar would be a start. Another facet would be differentiation of colors. This would distinguish the actual content's importance.
			</p>
			<!-- question5 -->
			<p><strong>	What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</strong></p>
			<p>
					My headings looked cluttered, therefore a seperation from the margin was needed. I looked up methods to clean up the edges of the headings from content, therefore I leearned of padding. Padding creates this seperation from the edges to give a less cluttered look. Another problem that arose was my webpage stated most of my pages weren't there. I reviewed my code and noticed my index html navigation's difference from secondary pages. I matched the primary pages navigation section's code with secondary sections and the pages could be viewed.
			</p>
			<!-- question6 -->
			<p><strong>	What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</strong></p>
			<p>
					The process was a hassle however I was able to create a webpage with sleek intial design. It's color scheme allows a focus on the most important aspect, the content.
			</p>
			<!-- question7 -->
			<p><strong>	If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</strong></p>
			<p>
					The secondary pages are blank besides color. If I were a teacher I would signify my lack of focus on these pages. Secondly the design is very ununique; this makes my audience feel my work is uncredible. I must add a type of unique nature to seperate myself from others.
