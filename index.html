<h2>Unit 1: HTML</h2>
	<!-- Add reflection questions below -->
<ol>
		<li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Vocabulary includes such as the tag head, which includes general information about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets. </li>
		<li> The body tag element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyper links, images, tables, etc.</li>
		<li> The paragraph element or "p" tag includes information surrounding a topic within the HTML document. </li>
		<li> All headings like h1 being the most important therefore largest, and h6 being the least important and therefore largest. </li>
		<li> Another term is list, which organizes all thoughts within the html. Unordered list allow organizations by bullets and ordered list allow organizations by bullets. </li>
		<li> Doctype tag is the first tag, which allows instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</li>
		<li> The Title tag succeeds the doctype tag and allows a name that differentiates it from other work. All these skills are essential in the makeup of this unit and HTML in totality.</li>
	</ul>
<ol>
		<li> What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study? </li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> The most important skills must be the structure of html, and the ability to make clickable links that allow organization. </li>
	</ul>
<ol>
		<li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> I have gotten better in all facets such as formatting a document, when to use tags, and the recognition of my mistakes. </li>
</ul>
<ol>
		<li>In what ways do you think you need to improve? </li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> I need to focus when list or paragraph usage fits and I need to check my code throughly.</li>
	</ul>
<ol>
		<li>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> The first problem was where to place the main tag, but after reviewing my organization, I knew that the main tag didn't have to be in the beginning of the code. It could be at the start of the list of units too. </li>
		<li>The second problem was how to create a clickable link on the units. I realized I didn't put quotation marks after checking my code, which are essentially to the creation of a clickable link.</li>
	</ul>
<ol>
<li> What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product? </li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> I always thought creating a web page would be impossible, but after learning the in and outs I feel like I could finally accomplish this. </li>
	</ul>
<ol>
		<li> If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?</li>
</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> At times I may had done unnecessary work although I got the job done. For example putting all eight units instead of the necessary six. </li>
	</ul>
